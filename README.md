Nowadays, when people plan for an event (such as a wedding ceremony, birthdays, anniversaries, etc) they often face many problems.
People who are looking for an organizer for their event, in the beginning, they get puzzled about where to go first or how to find
a better organizer. If their residences are far from the organizer’s office, distance seems like a big issue then. The next 
problem is, a client cannot get full and clear details of an event organizer. For this reason, they don't know what type of 
service they are going to receive and if they get a bad service which is not even close to their desired one, they cannot say 
anything against the service. The client may need to change the event date if an organizer gives a time schedule and it clashes 
with another. Sometimes it is so difficult for them. Serious problem is, overspending or not having enough money; often they ended
up spending more than their actual budget.
